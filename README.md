# Pip installation

To quickly install **KCL_PSO**, we encourage to do it inside a virtual environment, which can be achieved in the following way:

1. Create a directory named as you want and access it (in this case called work_pol):

```bash 
  [~] mkdir work_pso
  [~] cd work_pso
```

2. Create a virtual environment named pol (this name can be changed, of course) and activate the environment:

```bash 
   [~] python -m venv kcl_pso
   [~] source kcl_pso/bin/activate
```

3. Get KCL_PSO from the GitHub repository:

```bash 
  git clone https://github.com/alejandrosantanabonilla/PSO.git
```

4. Install KCL_PSO in this folder using the virtual environment

```bash 
   [~] cd pso
   [~] pip install .
```
